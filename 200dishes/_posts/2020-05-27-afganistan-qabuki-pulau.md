##### Country: Afganistan

##### Servings: 2

#### Ingredients

1. 2 cups basmati rice
2. 3.5 cups water
3. 2 tsp salt
4. (optional for vegetarian version) 5 -6 drumsticks or chicken thighs (with bone)
5. 1 large onion
6. 1/2 cup oil
7. 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth ( if making vegetarian version)
8. 1 tbsp cumin
9. 1/2 tsp cardamom
10. 1/2 tsp clove
11. 1/2 tsp black pepper
12. 1 large carrot
13. 1/2 cup raisins
14. 1/4 cup almonds slivered
15. 3 tbsp sugar


#### Algorithm


1. Preheat oven to 260°C (500°F)
2. Wash rise and set aside
3. Chop onion into small pieces
4. Chop carrots into thin sticks (3 thick). You can also grate it through a large grater.
5. Sauté the onions over high heat in the oil until they become brown (5-10 min). Keep stirring.
6. Add the chicken to the pan and sprinkle with salt. Cook the chicken over medium-high heat for 6-8 mins, turning from time to time so all sides turn golden brown.
7. Add 1/4 cup broth, and continue stirring to prevent the chicken from burning. Once the liquid has been absorbed, add another 1/4 cup, cover the dish and let it sit for 5 mins. The onions should caramelize and the chicken should be well browned at this point.
8. In a large frying pan bring 1 cup water to boil, add the carrots and cook until tender. Be careful not to overcook.
9. Once the carrots are cooked, drain the water. Add 2 tablespoons of oil, raisins, almonds and sugar to the carrots. Stir quickly over medium-high heat for about 3 min. The raisins will swell up. Be careful not to mash the carrots. Pack the carrots in a square piece of foil.
10. Remove the chicken pieces from the broth and set aside. Stir the cumin, cardamom, cloves and black pepper into the broth. Continue to cook on low heat for 5 min to allow it to thicken. You may add a bit of broth if the mixture starts to stick.
11. Boil rice until it is a al-dente. This may take 5 mins depending on the rice.
12. Immediately strain the rice. Put the rice into the skillet and add the sauce from the chicken. Stir well. Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the rice. Set the aluminum package of carrots on top of the rice. This will keep the carrots warm and deepen the flavours without mixing with the rice yet.
13. Bake the rice for 15 min at 260°C. Lower to 120°C (250°F) and cook for another 20 min
14. Arrange the chicken pieces and rice on the platter. Sprinkle the carrots mix on the rice.
15. You can garnish with some caramelized shallots.
